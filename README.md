-Description:

 “Colors and Their World" is an OER material easy to adapt in preschool.  It provides a playful land interactive learning experience that allows children to explore and expand their creativity. This OER includes flashcards that are being created from real - life photos, downloaded from flickr.com and being under cc licenses.  These flashcards can be easily used in many ways, such as mach up activity which can be both played in digital or physical form.  Online tools and a variety of activities are being also proposed in that project.
